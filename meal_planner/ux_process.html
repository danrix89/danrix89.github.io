            MyMealPlanner Web App
        </h1>
        <p class="explanation_text">
            The MyMealPlanner web app was designed to help those 
            who plan out monthly dinner calendars for their families.
            The following will guide you through the process I used
            to research, design, build, and test my application.

            Where to start?
        </h1>
        <p>
            I began by first by getting to know who my target audience was, what 
            interfaces they were using, and how they interacted with those interfaces.
            <br />
            Before I could even think of designing, I needed data.

    <div class="persona_scenario_criteria section">
        <hr>
        <h1>
            Know thy user
        </h1>
        <p>
            Second, I gathered more precise data about my target audience like,
            how tech savvy they are, their personalities, and other defining details.
            After I compiled the data I pieced together the commonalities into general
            a persona and scenario. Then I used those to build a heuristic analysis
            of my users' needs and wants of the desired interface. All throughout this
            process I continued to refine my data with more user interaction.

            Design iterations
        </h1>
        <p>
            Once I knew the users' needs I was able to start sketching up "breadth-first" ideas
            and testing them against my criteria. As a design met criteria, I'd iterate deeper
            and deeper until a design was stable. I then built high fidelity prototypes with a
            detailed specification.

            Build it and they will come
        </h1>
        <p>
            At this point, I was ready to build it. I followed my specification, but made sure
            to refine as I went along by sampling my work with users and innocent bystanders.

            The home stretch
        </h1>
        <p>
            The time had come to put my app to the test. I handed it over to a qualified
            peer who created a usability plan and let the users use it. The results came
            back with great news. My design was generally accepted. There were only a few
            small tweaks and polish points I had to make, but other than that, my hard work
            paid off.

        <hr>
        <h1>
            It's alive!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Since that point, I've continued to refine and polish the app based on user feedback.
            Little by little the app has become more and more what the users both want
            and need.
